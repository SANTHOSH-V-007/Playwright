*How to configure the text according to your choice

*Hooks:
    -Hooks allows us to run code before and after the text.
    -All Hooks are part of test API  provide by playwright
    -When we can use Hooks

Ex of Hooks:
    beforeAll():run code once before all test in file
    afterAll():run code once after all test in file
    beforeEach():run code everytime before all test in run file
    afterEach():run code everytime after all test in run file

*How to use record feature:
    -It provide test script after performing action on webapplication or webpahes.
    -To start record feature we use page.pause() method to test code

*use annotation.
*use of Hooks

test() : it os use to create block for particular test.
describe(): it is use to wrap multiple test cases together belongings same senarioa.

*Fixture:
    -It is reusable piece of setup and teardown logical code that you can share across test.
    -It works like helper function.
    -playwright provides us build-in fixtures as well as we can create custom fixtures.

Fixture task:
    you need to reuse login logic for multiple test using playwright fixtures for soucedemo.com website
objective:
    -create custom fixture to handle user login
    -use that fixture in multiple text.
    -perform  different action on dashboard(check title,add item to card)

*API Mocking In playwright:
    -Mocking Simulation API response without hitting the real backend.

*Why Mock?
-Backend is not ready
-Faster test
