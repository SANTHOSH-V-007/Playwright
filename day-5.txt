    -In End to End test we verify that the complete fuction of software application is working
    proper or not from start to finish.
    -We ensure that integrated component work together seamlessly.
    -In this we validate the entire workflow from users perspective.

    -Pass multiple user crenditals for login test

    4.CI/CD Integration with Git and GitHub.
    -In this we configure git and github with playwright.
    -There are two ways to use git amd github with playwright
        1.while creating playwright project provide yes option for git configuration.
        2.Create a yml file in existing project and write configuration setting in it.
            create proper folder structure for yml file.
            .github/workflow/playwright.yml
